# StringyMcStringFace

A smarter alternative to the standard `strings` command that uses binary analysis to extract meaningful strings from executables, focusing on data structures rather than arbitrary byte runs.

> **Why the stupid name?** My coworkers held a democratic vote and chose "StringyMcStringFace" over my more dignified suggestions. I trusted their maturity. This was a mistake. The command is still just `stringy` though.

---

## The Problem with `strings`

The standard `strings` command dumps every printable byte sequence it finds, which means you get:

- Padding bytes and table data
- Interleaved garbage in UTF-16 strings
- No context about where strings come from
- No prioritization of what's actually useful

**Stringy** solves this by being data-structure aware, section-aware, and semantically intelligent.

---

## What Makes Stringy Different

### **Data-Structure Aware**

Only extracts strings that are part of the binary's actual data structures, not arbitrary byte runs.

### **Section-Aware**

Prioritizes `.rodata`/`.rdata`/`__cstring`, resources, and version info; de-emphasizes writable `.data`; avoids `.bss`.

### **Encoding-Aware**

Supports ASCII/UTF-8, UTF-16LE (PE), and UTF-16BE; detects null-interleaved text.

### **Semantically Tagged**

Identifies URLs, domains, IPs, file paths, registry keys, GUIDs, user agents, format strings, Base64 runs, crypto constants, and cloud metadata.

### **Runtime-Specific**

Handles import/export names, demangled Rust symbols, section names, Go build info, .NET metadata, and PE resources.

### **Ranked**

Presents the most relevant strings first using a scoring algorithm.

---

## Features

- **Format-aware parsing** via [`goblin`](https://docs.rs/goblin): ELF, PE, Mach-O
- **Section targeting**: `.rodata`, `.rdata`, `__cstring`, resources, manifests
- **Encoding support**: ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16LE/BE with confidence scoring
- **Smart classification**:
  - URLs, domains, IPs
  - Filepaths & registry keys
  - GUIDs & user agents
  - Format strings (`%s`, `%d`, etc.)
  - Base64 & crypto constants
- **Rust symbol demangling** (`rustc-demangle`)
- **JSON output** for pipelines
- **YARA-friendly output** for rule generation
- **Ranking & scoring**: high-signal strings first

---

## Installation

```bash
cargo install stringy
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Analysis

```bash
stringy target_binary
```

### Focused Extraction

```bash
# Only URLs and file paths
stringy --only url,filepath target_binary

# Minimum length and encoding filters
stringy --min-len 8 --enc ascii,utf16 target_binary

# Top 50 results in JSON
stringy --top 50 --json target_binary
```

### PE-Specific Features

```bash
# Extract version info and manifests
stringy --pe-version --pe-manifest target.exe

# UTF-16 only (common in Windows binaries)
stringy --utf16-only target.exe
```

### Pipeline Integration

```bash
# JSON output for jq processing
stringy --json target_binary | jq '.matches[] | select(.tags[] | contains("url"))'

# YARA rule candidates
stringy --yara candidates.txt target_binary
```

## Example Output

**Human-readable mode:**

```
Score  Offset    Section    Tags           String
-----  ------    -------    ----           ------
  95   0x1000    .rdata     url,https      https://api.example.com/v1/
  87   0x2000    .rdata     guid           {12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc}
  82   0x3000    __cstring  filepath       /usr/local/bin/stringy
  78   0x4000    .rdata     fmt            Error: %s at line %d
```

**JSON mode:**

```json
{
  "text": "https://api.example.com/v1/",
  "offset": 4096,
  "rva": 4096,
  "section": ".rdata",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "length": 28,
  "tags": ["url"],
  "score": 95,
  "source": "SectionData"
}
```

## Advantages Over Standard `strings`

- **Eliminates noise**: Stops dumping padding, tables, and interleaved garbage
- **UTF-16 support**: Surfaces UTF-16 (crucial for PE) cleanly
- **Actionable buckets**: Provides categorized results (URLs, keys, UAs, registry paths) first
- **Provenance tracking**: Keeps offset/section info for pivoting to other tools
- **YARA integration**: Feeds only high-signal candidates

## Development Status

This project is in active development. Current focus:

- âœ… Basic format detection (ELF, PE, Mach-O)
- âœ… Core data structures and error handling
- ðŸš§ String extraction and classification
- ðŸš§ Ranking and scoring system
- ðŸš§ CLI interface and output formats

See the [implementation plan](.kiro/specs/stringy-binary-analyzer/tasks.md) for detailed progress.
